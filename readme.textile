Just threw this together quickly so that I can style jsfiddle embeds on my website (the default doesn't go well with dark websites).

To use, simply call:

  <pre>http://hostname/jsFiddle-skin-proxy/?id=mfKZF</pre>

To use an updated version of the jsfiddle simply add it to the id:

  <pre>http://hostname/jsFiddle-skin-proxy/?id=mfKZF/5</pre>

I make no guarantees for this script. I just threw it together quickly so that I can use embeds on my site properly. Hopefully jsFiddle will support custom css natively in the future.. or at least provide some more varied skins.
