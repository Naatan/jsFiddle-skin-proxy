Just threw this together quickly so that I can style jsfiddle embeds on my website (the default doesn't go well with dark websites).

To use, simply call like this:

  http://localhost/jsFiddle-skin-proxy/?id=mfKZF

To use an updated version of the jsfiddle simply add it like this:

  http://localhost/jsFiddle-skin-proxy/?id=mfKZF/5

I make no guarantees for this script. I just threw it together quickly so that I can use embeds on my site properly. Hopefully jsFiddle will support custom css natively in the future.. or at least provide some more varied skins.
